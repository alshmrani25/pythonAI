Tree where leaves are the answers.
Rather than binary questions, usually asks if "i > a"?
Partitions the training data (think squares on 2D data) to get minimal depth tree.

Main problem - overfitting. Uses pruning to avoid that (pre or post).
Some paras are max tree depth and max num of points in node to keep splitting it.
This causes train/test accuracy tradeoff.
NOTE - skikit-learn ONLY implements pre-pruning

NOTE - using GraphViz app to view .DOT files
