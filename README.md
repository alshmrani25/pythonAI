This repository contains exercises and explorations in 
artificial intelligence and machine learning using Python.

I'm using two books:

1. Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach, by Norvig 
and Russell (3rd ed). This was my university AI textbook, but I am 
going over it again using Python (my original class used 
Common Lisp, which isn't exactly a marketable language). This 
textbook uses pseudocode, and is not tied to any particular language.

2. Introduction to Machine Learning with Python: 
A Guide for Data Scientists, by Mueller and Guido (O'Reilly). This 
is a more up-to-date survey using Python.

There is overlap between the two books.
